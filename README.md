Plan things with just the broad strokes.

Dice Chest is a tool for planning events like dates, parties, and hangouts. Create lists of activities, and plan events by just selecting which types of activities you want, then Dice Chest will give you a list of specific activities from your lists.

I wanted this so my wife and I can plan our dates. We're have a "Dates" category, then lists of movies, board games, restaurants, places to walk, activities to do away from home etc.

To plan a date we just have to select which of those lists we want and in what order, e.g. "Walks -> Snacks/Drinks -> Activities (away from home) -> Restaurants -> Board game", and Dice Chest might suggest: a local park, a bubble tea location, walk around a local mall, get ramen at a place we've been interested in, then do a puzzle.
