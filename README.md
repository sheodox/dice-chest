# Dice Chest

**Dice Chest is WIP!**

Dice Chest is meant to be your decision maker for planning things like date nights, parties, etc. Create any categories you like to plan and create lists of activities inside there. When you're ready to do something, select the activity lists you want to chose between and it'll give you a plan!

I wanted this so my wife and I can plan our dates. We're going to have a "Dates" category, then lists of movies, board games, restaurants, places to walk, activities to do away from home etc.

To plan a date we can just go to the "Dates" category we made, select which of those lists we want and in what order, e.g. "Walks -> Snacks/Drinks -> Activities (away from home) -> Restaurants -> Board game", and Dice Chest might suggest: a local park, a bubble tea location, walk around a local mall, get ramen at a place we've been interested in, then do a puzzle.
